 * int temp = regvalue + 300;			//temp has value 500 now
 * regvalue += 300;						//now the registry has the value 500 too
 * \endcode
 * to avoid too much access to the registry the value is cached inside the object.
 * once the value is read, no more read accesses to the registry will be made.
 * this means the variable will contain a wrong value if the corresponding registry
 * entry is changed by anything else than this variable! If you think that could happen
 * then use 
 * \code
 * regvalue.read();
 * \endcode
 * to force a refresh of the variable with the registry.
 * a write to the registry is only made if the new value assigned with the variable
 * is different than the last assigned value.

/**
 * \ingroup CommonClasses
 * DWORD value in registry. with this class you can use DWORD values in registry
 * like normal DWORD variables in your program.
 * Usage:
 * in your header file, declare your registry DWORD variable:
 * \code
 * CRegStdWORD regvalue;
 * \endcode
 * next initialize the variable e.g. in the constructor of your class:
 * \code
 * regvalue = CRegStdWORD("Software\\Company\\SubKey\\MyValue", 100);
 * \endcode
 * this will set the registry value "MyValue" under HKEY_CURRENT_USER with path 
 * "Software\Company\SubKey" to the variable. If the key does not yet exist or
 * an error occured during read from the registry, a default
 * value of 100 is used when accessing the variable.
 * now the variable can be used like any other DWORD variable:
 * \code
 * regvalue = 200;						//stores the value 200 in the registry
 * int temp = regvalue + 300;			//temp has value 500 now
 * regvalue += 300;						//now the registry has the value 500 too
 * \endcode
 * to avoid too much access to the registry the value is cached inside the object.
 * once the value is read, no more read accesses to the registry will be made.
 * this means the variable will contain a wrong value if the corresponding registry
 * entry is changed by anything else than this variable! If you think that could happen
 * then use 
 * \code
 * regvalue.read();
 * \endcode
 * to force a refresh of the variable with the registry.
 * a write to the registry is only made if the new value assigned with the variable
 * is different than the last assigned value.
 * to force a write use the method write();
 * another option to force reads and writes to the registry is to specify TRUE as the
 * third parameter in the constructor.
